# HTTP Methods
As briefly discussed, HTTP methods are sent with API requests to indicate the actions you would like to take toward a resource. There are many API methods, so I will only list some important ones:

* POST request – creates a resource.
* GET request – retrieves information about a resource.
* PUT request – updates or creates a resource.
* DELETE request – deletes a resource.

HTTP methods correspond to <b>CRUD</b> Operations. For example, the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE correspond to create, read, update, and delete CRUD operations.
